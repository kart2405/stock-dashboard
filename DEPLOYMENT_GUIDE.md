# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Stock Dashboard to GitHub Pages.

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **Repository**: [https://github.com/kart2405/stock-dashboard](https://github.com/kart2405/stock-dashboard)  
✅ **Code**: Already pushed to GitHub  
✅ **GitHub Actions**: Configured for automatic deployment  
⏳ **GitHub Pages**: Needs to be enabled  

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository**: [https://github.com/kart2405/stock-dashboard](https://github.com/kart2405/stock-dashboard)

2. **Click the "Settings" tab** (top right of the repository)

3. **Scroll down to "Pages" section** (left sidebar)

4. **Configure Source**:
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - **Branch**: Leave as default (main)

5. **Save the settings**

### Step 2: Check GitHub Actions

1. **Go to "Actions" tab** in your repository
2. **Check if deployment workflow is running**
3. **Wait for it to complete** (usually 2-5 minutes)

### Step 3: Access Your Live Site

Once deployment is complete, your site will be available at:
**🌐 [https://kart2405.github.io/stock-dashboard/](https://kart2405.github.io/stock-dashboard/)**

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually or the automatic deployment doesn't work:

### Option 1: Deploy Demo Version (Recommended)

Since we have Node.js compatibility issues, the demo version works best:

1. **The demo is already deployed** in the `index.html` file
2. **GitHub Pages will automatically serve** the `index.html` file
3. **Your site will be live** at the GitHub Pages URL

### Option 2: Build and Deploy (If Node.js 18+ available)

If you have Node.js 18+ available:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# The dist/ folder will be created
# GitHub Actions will automatically deploy this
```

## 🎯 Your Live URLs

- **Main Demo**: [https://kart2405.github.io/stock-dashboard/](https://kart2405.github.io/stock-dashboard/)
- **Alternative Demo**: [https://kart2405.github.io/stock-dashboard/demo.html](https://kart2405.github.io/stock-dashboard/demo.html)
- **Repository**: [https://github.com/kart2405/stock-dashboard](https://github.com/kart2405/stock-dashboard)

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- [ ] Source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow has completed successfully
- [ ] Site loads at the GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] All features work (search, loading states, etc.)
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled (GitHub Pages automatically provides this)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading
1. **Check GitHub Actions**: Ensure deployment workflow completed successfully
2. **Verify Pages Settings**: Confirm GitHub Pages is enabled
3. **Wait**: Sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
4. **Clear Cache**: Try accessing in incognito mode

### GitHub Actions Failing
1. **Check Node.js Version**: The workflow uses Node.js 18
2. **Check Build Logs**: Look at the Actions tab for error details
3. **Fallback**: The `index.html` demo will work regardless

### HTTPS Issues
1. **Wait for SSL**: GitHub automatically provisions SSL certificates
2. **Enable HTTPS**: Check "Enforce HTTPS" in Pages settings
3. **Clear Cache**: Try accessing in incognito mode

## 🎉 Success!

- ✅ **Professional URL**: `https://kart2405.github.io/stock-dashboard/`
